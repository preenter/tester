            <h1>Linking HTML to JS</h1>
            <p>Why is JavaScript so popular? It's the primary language used by most modern web browsers. Despite its early quirks, which gave it a bit of a bad reputation, JavaScript has continually evolved and improved. Today, it stands as a powerful, flexible, and fast programming language used for complex web development and beyond.</p><br>
            <p>JavaScript remains at the core of web development, making it the go-to language for many self-taught coders eager to learn and build. We’re excited to see what you’ll create with the JavaScript skills you gain here. JavaScript powers the dynamic behavior on most websites, including this one.</p><br>
            <p>In this lesson, you'll learn introductory coding concepts such as data types and built-in objects—essential knowledge for all aspiring developers. Make sure to take notes and pace yourself. This foundation will prepare you for understanding the more complex concepts you'll encounter later.</p><br>
